RemLoc - reminder and notification application 

The RemLoc app is a tool that will help you remember important things you want to do in specific places. You can set reminders for each place where you want to do something, for example, "Buy bread at the store" or "Call the client when I'm in the office". When you arrive at the designated location, you will receive a notification with the reminder you previously set. 

This app also has a feature for automatically sending SMS messages to relatives and friends upon arrival at a previously designated location. This is useful if you want to inform your loved ones that you have arrived safely at your destination or if you need their help in any situation. With this app, you will never forget about important things you wanted to do in a specific place.

Our app is ideal for people who like active leisure and want to spend time with friends playing urban games. It is also suitable for discovering attractions during history, geography, biology and many other subject lessons, making learning more understandable and exciting. Thanks to RemLoc, organizing an urban game will be much easier and more enjoyable. Join the fun now and broaden your horizons!"
